<summary>1. Use Hydra to find the VNC password of the target with IP address `MACHINE_IP`. What is the password?</summary>

```1q2w3e4r```<br><br>It appears this VNC server does not require a username, which is nice because we don't know a valid one.

<summary>2. Using a VNC client on the AttackBox, connect to the target of IP address `MACHINE_IP`. What is the flag written on the targetâ€™s screen?</summary>
